🧠 Employee Resignation Risk Prediction System
Final Project – Rakamin Academy Data Science Bootcamp (Batch 52)
🏆 Best Group of Final Project Award

📌 Overview
This project was built as part of the capstone for the 6-month Data Science Bootcamp at Rakamin Academy.
Our team developed a machine learning–powered system that predicts the likelihood of employee resignation, helping organizations proactively manage talent retention.

🎯 Business Impact
The model successfully reduced the predicted employee turnover rate from 28.5% to 7.5%, beating the industry benchmark of 10%.
This solution showcases the power of data-driven decision-making in human resource analytics.
